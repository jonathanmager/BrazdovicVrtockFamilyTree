        Brazdovic - Vrtock Family Information 
    </h1>
        <p>
        These notes are related to the family tree and family history centered around Ernestine  Vrtock Brazdovic along with husbands Peter Vrtock and Paul Brazdovic who are grandparents to Paula Zelipsky Zabek, Stephen Zelipsky, John and Dan Krajcovic, Jim  and Rick and Bob Mager. 
        Ernestine was born in 1889 and died in January 1972. Her formal name is Ernestina as  marked on her gravestone (<a href = "https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/181187505/ernestina brazdovic/photo" onclick="handleClick();">link</a>  )

        A family tree described below shows her maiden name is Ernestina Jankovicova. She  was daughter of Henry Jankovic and Anna Valentovicova; Anna was daughter to Juraj  Valentovic and Alzbeta Dekanova. The name Jankovic/Jankovicova was typically  spelled with a starting J and sometime with a starting Y, but usually seen as J. 
        Ernestina is from a suburb of Bratislava, Slovakia. It is not clear the exact name of that  suburb - perhaps heard something that sounds phonetically like “Bolinraz” but the  spelling and exact location is not available. At the time, it was a farming area and  Bratislava was the closest major city. When she was a teenager, she did not want to  work in the fields any longer and moved to Vienna Austria getting a job as a maid. She  told of stories where she enjoyed going to a park, hearing the music, and remembered  big parades with soldiers on horses associated with Franz Joseph, emperor of the  Habsburg dynasty. 
        When Ernestine came to the United States, she lived in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. She  married young to Peter Vrtock and had daughter Anne (July 19, 1912 - April 4, 2006) with formal name Anastasia. Here is a 1914 picture of them.

        Peter died in an accident while working for the Carnegie Steel Company. They had so  little money, she had to beg for donations from neighbors to pay for the funeral. Then  she did housekeeping to earn money, but that meant she needed help to raise daughter  Anne. So, a relative in Pittsburgh who was widowed and had two kids took Anne in,  and Ernestine would visit on weekends and whenever she could. 
        Paul Brazdovic lived next door to where Anne was living. Paul was also born in 1889  and originally was from the Bratislava area too although it is believed he and Ernestine did not know each other back then. Paul had a wife and daughter who both died of  tuberculosis. The daughter died shortly after Ernestine and Paul married. 
        Ernestine and Paul eventually lived on Carson Street in Pittsburgh. Later they moved to  Bellaire, Ohio as Paul worked for the Carnegie Steel Works which was located where the old “donkey fields” were located roughly near 42nd street in Bellaire. A picture is

        They moved not too far away somewhere north of 38th Street near Trumbell or Franklin  Streets in Bellaire; the timeframe would have been around 1918-1919 around the time  of the Spanish flu epidemic across the world. Ernestine later claimed that she didn’t get  ill and nursed the sick that lived in the multi-family house they shared. At some later  time, they moved to 4535 Harrison Street in Bellaire. The duplex house is shown here: 
         Ernestine and Paul lived on the left side. At the time, the people on the right side also  ran a barber shop (you can see a sign hanging off the porch in front of the door). 
        Pauline was born 4 years after Anne and Velma was born about 6 years later. Pauline: Aug 9, 1916 - Nov 15, 2005 
        Velma: Jan 12, 1923 - Oct 10, 1989

        Paul had several strokes later in life and had a major one that paralyzed one side and  made walking very difficult and he then could not speak. He died in 1960. Ernestine died in January 1972.

        Pauline took a trip to Slovakia in 1983, and while visiting there, was provided the  following family tree. We believe it is not a complete family tree but showing Pauline  where she was in the generations shown (e.g., Anne and Velma are not shown).<br>15 <br>
        Other extended family. 
        • Paul Brazdovic had a sister whose married name was Petronek so their children  were first cousins to Anne/Pauline/Velma. 
        Mike Petronek with Don Mager, 1946 
        Msgr. Tom Petronek, ordained May 25, 1965, Diocese of Steubenville 
        • Paul Brazdovic had a brother Steve whose wife was named Fransca. They were  parents of Paul and Anne Porter. 
        Side stories: 
        • When Don was dating Velma and Paula was nearby, Paula was afraid and would  cry when Don was around. So to make friends with her, Don said he would take  Paula (age 4 then) on “a date.” Eventually, he took her to Duvall's Drugstore in  Bellaire where they had a soda fountain in the back of the store, and Don bought  Paula a hot fudge sundae. They became good friends after that. The following  is a picture of the two of them on August 17, 1947.
        <br>16 <br>
        • Various families (Zelipsky, Krajcovic, Mager) all remember many picnics at  Wheeling Park primarily near the playground areas but also going to the swimming pool and the “White Palace.” Picnic baskets containing fried chicken,  potato salad, thermos jugs with Kool Aid, and Velma's brownies with powered  sugar were often part of it. Here are various pictures:

        • The building on the southeast corner of Guernsey and 37th Streets in Bellaire where all children/grandchildren went to school has an interesting history. It was  originally a two-story building – originally St John church was on the second floor;  later the grade school was on the first floor and the high school was on the  second floor (Velma would have gone here) until the new high school was built in  1949. The building was converted from May of 1954 to March of 1955 to a three story school building (see picture below). Btw, Steve Zelipsky helped with the  electrical work of the building transformation.
        <br>19 <br>
        • Related to the house that Ernestine and Paul Brazdovic lived at 4535 Harrison  Street in Bellaire, here is some further information regarding the kind of  environment they and their children lived in. This house initially had no inside  plumbing and there was an outhouse on the back porch. Indoor plumbing came  sometime later. There was also building in the backyard. Part of it was used as  an apartment rented out to Margaret Fry (believed lived there after divorcing Jim  Fry; also had a son who was a Bellaire policeman). The basement of the  building was used by the Brazdovics. Paul had a bench where he fixed/resoled  shoes. He also made homegrown dandelion and elderberry wine there.  Additionally, they did their laundry in the basement of that building and also did  some canning there. 
        • Paul and Ernestine never had a car and either walked or relied on public  transportation. For example, after Carnegie Steel closed, Paul worked in  Benwood, WV (across the Ohio River from Bellaire). He walked over the Bellaire  Bridge and then took a trolley to work. Separately, as every Friday was payday,  he would stop and get a beer on the way home. 
        • Several Thanksgivings for all the extended family were held at the Zelipsky's  house (main floor and basement). The last one there followed John F Kennedy’s  assassination in November 1963. Several after that were in the Mager’s house. 
        • Don and Velma were one of the last to buy a television, and finally did so in  1954. But before then, there are some great memories visiting the Zelipskys on  Tuesday nights for boxing sponsored by Pabst Blue Ribbon and Friday night  boxing sponsored by Gillette Blue Blades. The Mager’s also had timely visits to  Grandma to watch I Love Lucy, Sargent Bilko — The Phil Silvers Show, the Red  Skelton Show, and the NIT when Duquesne won a few games. Later on in the  latter 1960s, family members would often gather at Grandma Brazdovic’s house  on Sunday evenings for dinner and then watch The Ed Sullivan Show. 
        • Related to the Zelipsky house on Noble Street, there are these additional shared  memories. There were some baseball games played in the backyard – the ball  was pitched toward the house and a goal was to hit the ball over the back fence  but some balls were fouled off backwards and hit the house or break some glass.  Also, at one time, Steve (dad) bought boxing gloves and would take Buddy and  Jim down to the basement, but Anne didn’t allow them to hit each other. There  were games of “electric football” where the gameboard would make this loud  buzzing noise which could annoy the adults, but the kids loved playing it. Other  memories include kids going to the bedroom and Paula coming over and telling  scary stories. 
        • Ernestine never did go back to Slovakia. It is quite remarkable she left home at  an early age going to Vienna and then to the United States, surely going through  hard times with her new life in America yet raising a wonderful family. After  World War II, she would be in contact with her old family but we do not have 
        20 
        details; assume to be mostly letters. She would send large packages of clothing  back to relatives in Slovakia, and can remember Anne/Pauline/Velma doing  similar years later. 
        Below are various pictures involving the cousins Paula, Steve, John, Dan, Jim, Rick,  and Bob. First, as a reference, here is the family tree / relationships for these cousins.
